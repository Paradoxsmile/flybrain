Machine learning on the *Drosophila* connectome: how much of a neuron's identity is encoded in its wiring alone, and what does connectome-constrained modelling of the fly visual system tell us about the role of wiring?

> Status: part b has results on FlyWire (FAFB v783), including a cross-hemisphere test. The MCNS transfer and part c are open.

## Motivation

Whole-brain connectomes (FlyWire/FAFB, Male CNS) list every neuron and synapse of an adult fly brain. Cell types are defined largely by morphology and connectivity, which raises two questions: can a model recover them from connectivity alone, and does the wiring diagram by itself constrain function?

## Research Questions

- **Part b.** Can a GNN predict super class and cell type of a neuron from pure connectivity on FlyWire (FAFB)? Does a model trained on FAFB transfer to the Male CNS (MCNS) connectome?
- **Part c.** Can the connectome-constrained visual-system network of Lappalainen et al. (2024, "flyvis") be reproduced, and how do its predictions change under ablations: real vs. degree-preserving shuffled vs. random wiring?

## Data

FlyWire (FAFB) and MCNS data are released under CC-BY. Raw files are **not** in this repository and must be placed manually in `data/raw/`; see [data/README.md](data/README.md) for expected files and licenses. Check them with `python data/download_fafb.py`.

## Methods

- **Graph:** neurons are nodes; directed edges pre → post, weighted by synapse count (Codex FAFB v783, which keeps connections with ≥ 5 synapses). Raw tables are cleaned once and cached as Parquet.
- **Labels:** `super_class` (10 classes) and `cell_type`, restricted to types with ≥ 20 neurons (434 types, 78 % of neurons).
- **GNN** (`train_gnn.py`, model in `flybrain/models.py`): input features are six degree / synapse-count statistics per neuron, so the model sees anonymous wiring structure and never the labels of other neurons. Each layer averages separately over presynaptic inputs and postsynaptic outputs, weighted by synapse count. Configs: `configs/default.yaml` (super_class: 4 layers, 1000 epochs), `configs/cell_type.yaml` (3 layers, 300 epochs, class-weighted loss); depth and options were chosen on validation.
- **Baselines** (`baselines.py`, `baseline_logreg.py`), ordered by the information they use: majority class; logistic regression on a neuron's own degree features; label propagation (connected neurons share a label); partner profile, i.e. logistic regression on the share of a neuron's synapses per partner class, using the labels of training neurons, which is what connectivity-based cell typing compares; plain GraphSAGE (inputs only, unweighted, same depth as the GNN).
- **Splits:** `random` (stratified 70 / 15 / 15) and `left_right` / `right_left` (train and validate on one hemisphere, test on the other).
- **Model selection:** hyperparameters and the training epoch are chosen by validation macro-F1; the test set is only used for the final numbers.
- **Benchmark:** `benchmark.py` runs every method on every label and split for three seeds and writes `results/benchmark/summary.md`. All runs log config, metrics and per-neuron predictions to `results/<run_name>/`.
- **Part c:** plan only, see [experiments/c_constrained_rnn](experiments/c_constrained_rnn/README.md).

## Quickstart

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
uv run python experiments/b_gnn_celltypes/baseline_logreg.py --synthetic
uv run python experiments/b_gnn_celltypes/train_gnn.py --synthetic
uv run python experiments/b_gnn_celltypes/baselines.py --method partner_profile --synthetic
```

Full comparison on the real data (several hours on CPU; resumable, and can be split with `--labels` / `--methods`):

```bash
uv run python experiments/b_gnn_celltypes/benchmark.py
```

CPU works by default; CUDA is used automatically when available.

## Results

FlyWire FAFB v783, test accuracy (%) / macro-F1, mean ± std over 3 seeds, produced by `benchmark.py` (baselines on CPU at commit `2000b7b`, GNN rows on a Kaggle T4 GPU at `343125f`). Hemisphere columns: trained on the first hemisphere, tested on the second.

Findings:

- **Anonymous wiring identifies neurons better than partner identities do.** On cell types, the GNN beats the partner profile (95.3 vs. 92.2 %), most clearly on rare types (macro-F1 0.93 vs. 0.79), without seeing any partner's label.
- **Only the anonymous model works on an unlabeled hemisphere.** In the hemisphere splits the median test neuron has no synapses to a labeled partner (optic-lobe circuits stay on their side), so the partner profile collapses, while the GNN keeps 87–98 %.
- **Seeing outputs matters most.** Averaging over postsynaptic partners as well as inputs adds 2–9 points accuracy and 0.13–0.23 macro-F1 over GraphSAGE of the same depth in every column. In the ablation (`ablation.py`), synapse weighting helps only cell types, and class weighting (with bidirectional aggregation) helps cell types but hurts super classes.
- **Depth helps up to a point.** A third layer mainly separates sibling optic-lobe types (T4 / T5 subtypes, which differ in the motion direction they encode); a fourth helps only super classes, mostly their rare classes. Deeper models were not better on validation.
- **Homophily explains little.** 71 % of synapses connect neurons of the same super class (35 % by chance), but only 3 % connect neurons of the same cell type (1.3 % by chance): the brain is wired heterophilously at the type level, so label propagation fails on cell types.
- **Reconstruction differences hurt.** Right → left cell typing is 8 points below left → right, with 2 or 3 layers alike. The hemispheres differ in the number of connections per neuron for several optic-lobe types, and the errors concentrate there (photoreceptors R1-6 and lamina neurons). Per-hemisphere feature normalization and edge-dropping augmentation (`feature_norm`, `drop_edge`) did not close the gap, and neither did more depth.

## Limitations

- Cell types were defined partly from connectivity, including matching across hemispheres and brains (Schlegel et al., 2024), so recovering them from wiring is partly circular. The GNN never sees partner identities, which weakens this concern but does not remove it. Super classes are mostly defined anatomically.
- Only types with ≥ 20 neurons are predicted (434 of 8,772 types); the many rare types are left out.
- The setting is transductive: the whole graph is visible during training, only the labels of validation and test neurons are hidden.
- One animal. The hemisphere split shows sensitivity to reconstruction completeness, so a transfer to another dataset (MCNS) is expected to be harder.
- Each seed changes both the data split and the initialization; the std covers both.
- The cell-type GNN is trained for 300 epochs and its best epoch is close to the end, so it may be slightly underestimated.
- Codex drops connections with fewer than 5 synapses.
- FAFB and MCNS differ in proofreading state, synapse detection and annotation schemes; transfer results depend on how neurons and classes are aligned.
- The synthetic graph is for testing only and says nothing about biology.
